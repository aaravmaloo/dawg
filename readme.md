    Dog Catcher Discord Bot 
</h1>
The dogcatcher (dc) bot is the bot you need for making your server's channels come alive. 
Inspired from the cat bot, this bot randomly spawns in dogs in your server. Each user has their collections and can view by 
running the /inventory command.

# <center > Features 
This bot contains A LOT of features; and trusts when I say that.

- Admins can customize spawn timings using /changespawntimings. However, they will only apply when the next dog is caught after running the command.
- Admins can also /forcespawn dogs. 
- Admins can also /givedog to reward someone.
- Users can view their inventory by /inventory. 
- Users can also craft dogs using some dogs. For example, you can create a Void dog (type) by using /craft then in option selecting the dog recipe. Here in this case, the recipe is /craft Void Dog and it would use 50 Golden Dogs and 17 master dogs. 
- Admins can customize what users can craft and disable crafting recipies. 
- Users can run /quest. When they successfully complete a quest, they get the above-specified dog. 
- Users can also do /steal. They can steal from other users, they have a 25% chance to steal successfully. If the steal round is unsuccessful, dog police will catch the thief and the thief would have to pay five normal dogs. If a user has attempted and failed five times, they would recieve a wanted level. It can be cleared if the next (sixth) theft was successful. If not; then the user will not be able to collect any cats for 24 hours. Users can protect their dogs by purchasing /shield. It costs five normal dogs.
- Users can also view their shield status and get notified when one is used.
- Users can also craft power-ups called arc reactors; each one has its own use and its own crafting recipe. 
- To view all craft able things, you can type /craftables (then select arc reactors all scrabbles to list or to list all craft-able dogs.) 
- Admins need to configure crafting or disable it completely. 
- Arc Reactors have power-ups; one includes a higher chance of theft, and the reactor "Shield Bypasser" has a 20% chance to bypass a user's shield and be able to theft.
